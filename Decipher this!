You are given a secret message you need to decipher. Here are the things you need to know to decipher it:

For each word:

the second and the last letter is switched (e.g. Hello becomes Holle)
the first letter is replaced by its character code (e.g. H becomes 72)
there are no special characters used, only letters and spaces
words are separated by a single space
there are no leading or trailing spaces
Examples

'72olle 103doo 100ya' --> 'Hello good day'
'82yade 115te 103o'   --> 'Ready set go'



const decipherThis  = (str) => {
const regex = /\d+/g;
 const replace = (match) => String.fromCharCode(parseInt(match,10));
 const decipheredText = str.replaceAll(regex, replace) 
function swapFirstAndLastLetters(word) {
  if (word.length <= 1) return word;

  let chars = word.split('');
  let firstLetter = chars[1];
  let lastLetter = chars[chars.length - 1];
  
  chars[1] = lastLetter;
  chars[chars.length - 1] = firstLetter;

  return chars.join('');
}
  let letterChange = decipheredText.split(' ').map(swapFirstAndLastLetters).join(' ')
  return letterChange
}
