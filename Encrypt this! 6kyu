Description:
Encrypt this!

You want to create secret messages which can be deciphered by the Decipher this! kata. Here are the conditions:

Your message is a string containing space separated words.
You need to encrypt each word in the message using the following rules:
The first letter must be converted to its ASCII code.
The second letter must be switched with the last letter
Keepin' it simple: There are no special characters in the input.



function encryptThis (text) {
  const first = /(?<=\b)\w/g; // selects first letter of every word
  const replace = (match) => match.charCodeAt(0)
 function swapFirstAndLastLetters(word) {
  if (word.length <= 1) return word;

  let chars = word.split('');
  let firstLetter = chars[1];
  let lastLetter = chars[chars.length - 1];
  
  chars[1] = lastLetter;
  chars[chars.length - 1] = firstLetter;

  return chars.join('');
}
  let letterChange = text.split(' ').map(swapFirstAndLastLetters).join(' ')
  return letterChange.replaceAll(first, replace)
}
