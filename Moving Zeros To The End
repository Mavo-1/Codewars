//parameters - a single array with multiple types of elements including numbers, strings, booleans
//returns - a single array with same elements but zeros at the end of the array. The other elements should remain in the same locatino in the array.
//examples - moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) // returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]
//psuedo code -  iterate through the original array and assign each value to a new array bucket depending on if zero or not. Join the buckets together and output.
